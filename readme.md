## ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- Server on ```127.0.0.1:8000```
  - not meant to be a web-framework, but a simple ui

- Dom generated from the content of values
  
  - ```example: "<input value='" + value + "'/>"```
  - ```UNSAFE because value content can generate/modify html or javascript.```

- If the widget id is the address of a value, two input widgets of the same value will trigger twice (need more thinking for solution)



- Blocking loop by default
- Exit loop if request from other than "127.0.0.1" by default 
  - As an additional safeguard (not been tested)

- ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• [How 'widgets' attempts(‚ö†Ô∏è) to maintain the rendering up-to-date ?](#how-widgets-attempts%EF%B8%8F-to-maintain-the-rendering-up-to-date-)
  - Will spin the loop multiple times and send only last rendition as response
  - ```should_re_render()``` for user initiated triggering!
    - once response is sent, need to wait for next request (blocking socket)



- Probably more

  - Arrow.Right (Up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, Down ‚¨áÔ∏è, Right ‚û°Ô∏è, Left ‚¨ÖÔ∏è)

&nbsp;

## Mechanism
The address of a value passed as an ```inout argument``` is used as a dom element id to check for events.

For example, ```GUI.Slider("Slider",val)``` will generate an html input element with the id ```address of val```.

The generated html is sent, and the page listen for any event on ```<body>```.

If an event occur on the page, it first check if the target element is marked with data-attribute (example: data-change).

If it is the case, an url is generated, according to:
-  the e.target dom element id
- the target value (depending on wich widget it represent)

In this example: ```/slider_address_of_val/new_dom_element_value```.

The page is then redirected to that url in order to "send" the event.

On the mojo side, an event is "received" and
the loop runs again. 

This time, the inout argument address will correspond to the current event url and the new value is assigned.

Anything can be used to generate an id, require more thinking ! 


&nbsp;
# How 'widgets' attempts(‚ö†Ô∏è) to maintain the rendering up-to-date ?

> Please make sure to read this section up to the end!
 
When widgets handles an event, 

they also mark the current response as potentially based on out-of-date values.

So the loop will runs again (one more time, if not reached limit), 

in order to reduce the probability of a page partially containing out-of-date values.

&nbsp;

And more, 
it should run as many times as needed until two successive renditions are equals!

It is also possible to call *"should re-render anyway"* anywhere, 

making very interesting logic possible: ```GUI.should_re_render()```.

There is an additional safeguard on the maximum number of renditions: ```+/- 10 by default```.

*(in attempt to avoid infinite loops)*

The idea is also to try to reduce the probabilities of interacting with out-of-date values:

**Only the last rendition will be sent for interaction(üî•)!** 



&nbsp;

On the top right corner, 

the number of iterations done (more or less) to generate the page is shown for debugging.

Note that two successive frames might not be enough, in somes cases,

 but it is a start and feedbacks are welcomed!

Example illustrating the new features: [Simple todo list](demo_simple_todo_list.mojo)

&nbsp;

#### Another example:
```python
from ui import *
def main():
    GUI = Server[base_theme="theme_neutral.css"]()
    var color:String = "#3584E4"
    var favorite_color:String = "#33D17A"
    var pos = Position(128,128,2.0)
    while GUI.Event(): 
        with GUI.Window("Test",pos,"background-color:"+color):
            if color == favorite_color:
                color = "#FFFFAA"
                GUI.should_re_render()
            GUI.Text(color)
            GUI.Text(favorite_color)
            if GUI.Button(" ‚úÖ Set as favorite color "):
                favorite_color = color 
            GUI.ColorSelector(color)
```
Note that if the favorite color is clicked two times in a row,

The additional safeguard did prevent the infinite loop! *(see top right corner)*



&nbsp;

## Characteristics:
### üèúÔ∏è Less dependencies
- Use a socket as PythonObject for now
- To make it platform agnostic and ready to runs anywhere with little changes.

### üõû Non blocking event loop (default mode: blocking)
- Usecase: if no request/event, custom user defined calculations on multiple workers.
- Additionally, slowed down by a call to the time.sleep()

### üèïÔ∏è Immediate mode vs retained
- Works inside an explicitely user-defined loop
  - the user choose what should happen when there are no events. (not implemented yet)
- The full dom is re-generated after each event 
### üé® CSS and HTML
- Interesting features:
  - audio/video playing
  - drag and drop
  - modals
  - more
- To implement custom widgets
  - Both are user friendly and easy to learn






&nbsp;
## Challenges for UTF8 support:
The new value of an TextInput() is passed to mojo trough the URL (GET request).

As a temporary solution, the new value is converted to UTF8 by javascript.

On the mojo side, part the url is splitted by "-" and atol() is used with chr().

Example: ```/change_140732054756824/104-101-108-108-111```

‚ö†Ô∏è 
- There is an unknown maximum size for new values! ( because URLs are size limited)
- Currenly, the socket will only read 1024 bytes from the request. (can be changed)

For theses reasons, an additional safeguard is provided (untested):
  - For the TextInput widget:
    - The input DOM element is limited with the ```maxlength='32'``` attribute by default.

Need more thinking! any ideas ?

&nbsp;

# üé® The current styling system
The idea is to provide choices of default CSS to act as a base and include theses inside the ```<style>``` tag.

The default css of the widgets is 'defined' with the class attribute.

It is possible to 'patch' it on the fly with a style attribute next to it (on the right)!

This is how individual widgets instances can be customized on top of a base style (example, another font-size for that button).

The customization part could become a new abstraction on top of css. (optional user-friendly helper functions, for example)

Eventually, abstraction and pure css should be both be avaiblable.


### Example
Here is the base style for the Button widget *(theme.css)*:
```css
/* ... */
.Button_ {
    border-width: 4px;border-color: black;border-style: solid;
    color: blue; background-color: yellow; max-width: fit-content;
}
/* ... */
```
Button can take additional CSS as a keyword argument for the ```style``` attribute of the DOM element:
```python
with GUI.Tag("div","padding:0px;margin:0px;font-size:100"):
    GUI.Text("‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•")
    #Additional CSS:
    GUI.Button("ok",CSS="font-size:32;background-color:"+colorvalue)
```

### Different base themes (CSS)
By default, the type will use "theme.css" as a base style, it is possible to change it in the parameters:

```python
GUI = Server[base_theme="theme_neutral.css"]()
```

Additionally, the theme can specified on the command-line:

*(Thanks to [Carl Caulkett](https://github.com/carlca/) for the suggestion üî•)*

```
mojo run -D mojo_ui_html_theme="theme_neutral.css" demo_principal.mojo
```

&nbsp;

# For the future:
- Toast messages (```notifications```)
- A ```node system``` (plug, drag-drop)
- Widget to form a number using the scrollwheel (modify individual hovered digits)
- ```XHR Post``` instead of ```get /widget_id/newvalue  ```
  - should fix ```%20``` problem
  - play ```audio``` in an independent DOM element
- ```Drag and drop``` capabilities (example: list to list)

- ‚úèÔ∏è

&nbsp;

## Current implementation challenges:
- Can't do nested type to create a tree of dom elements without pointers, better to wait a little for that.
  - ( ```struct Element(CollectionElement): var elements: DynamicVector[Self]``` )
  - the dom could be transfered as json and re-generated safer-ly in a loop.

- ```onchange``` is used instead of ```oninput``` (to not keep track of dom element focus, temporarely)
  - solved by generating serialized dom as nested nodes, and "morphing" it
- More
